## Dynamic Array Visualization

Project Status: 

This project aims to provide a visual representation of a dynamic array using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The dynamic array is a data structure that automatically resizes itself when it becomes full, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of elements.

### Features:

1. Interactive UI: The project includes an interactive user interface where users can perform various operations on the dynamic array.
2. Add Elements: Users can add elements to the dynamic array, and if the array is full, it will automatically resize to accommodate new elements.
3. Remove Elements: Users can remove elements from the array, and the array will adjust its size accordingly.
4. Update Elements: Users can update the value of an element at a specific index in the array.
5. Visual Feedback: The project provides visual feedback to demonstrate the resizing of the array when elements are added or removed.
6. Array Visualization: The current state of the dynamic array is visually displayed, allowing users to see the elements and their positions in the array.
7. Array Information: The project displays relevant information about the dynamic array, such as the current number of elements and the array's capacity.

By visualizing the dynamic array, this project helps users understand how the array expands and shrinks dynamically to accommodate data efficiently. It serves as a learning tool to grasp the concept and behavior of dynamic arrays in a more intuitive and interactive manner.
